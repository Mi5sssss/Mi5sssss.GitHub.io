**Welcome to my page!** I am a PhD student in the ECSE Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tong Zhang](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/~tzhang/).
I previously completed a Bachelor of Engineering with Honors in Southern University of Science and Technology, where I worked with [Prof. Quan Chen](https://sme.sustech.edu.cn/en/index/teacher/neiye/id/40.html).

My research focuses on optimizing memory architectures, primarily DRAM and SSDs, to enhance hardware performance and software efficiency. I explore solutions in data processing and AI, aiming to contribute to more efficient and sustainable computing systems.

Welcome to talk to me!
