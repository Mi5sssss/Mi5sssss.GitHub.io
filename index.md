I am a PhD student in the [Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/), [School of Engineering](https://eng.rpi.edu/), at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/). I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tong Zhang](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/~tzhang/).
I previously completed a Bachelor of Engineering with Honors at [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.sustech.edu.cn/en/), [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), where I worked with [Prof. Quan Chen](https://sme.sustech.edu.cn/en/index/teacher/neiye/id/40.html). Here is [My CV](doc\xie_cv_display.pdf).

## üìöCurrent Interests and Projects

- **Storage and Cache System Design**
  - B-tree Based Cache System with Data Compression in DRAM:
    1. DRAM/SSD-based caching systems play an important role in modern IT infrastructure
    2. DRAM accounts for a significant (and increasing) portion of system TCO
    3. NAND flash memory has limited (and decreasing) P/E cycling endurance
