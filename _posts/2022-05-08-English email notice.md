寫在前面的話：

郵件的的至高境界不在於辭藻華麗，而是“得體”。郵件雖然很很短，卻透露出一個人的休養內涵。常說字如其人，郵件的表達就如同一扇打開著的窗戶，站在外面的聰明人可以把你看看個大概。

外企工作5年經驗，因為在法企，對英語郵件的要求不是很高（法式浪漫主義英語你懂得）。外加內部溝通偏多，英語郵件技巧沒有提升很快。現在進入一家英國外資企業，郵件水準一下子暴露，郵件品質很渣，經常被叫去辦公室被老闆指點江山。所以，痛定思痛，花了挺長一段時間思考，並苦苦搜羅了下身邊同事和客戶的優質郵件和網路資料（引用自：[https://**blog.talaera.com/busine**ss-emails-phrases](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//blog.talaera.com/business-emails-phrases) ），從中找點好的例句和思路。

整理了如下150句非常實用的英文郵件例句，幫助你快速搭建一個郵件的結構。外加自己在工作中高頻使用的幾個場景案例，有些句子甚至可以直接“拿來主義”。讓你的郵件編輯效率起飛，目標是讓老闆對你的郵件無話可說！！！

## 第一章：思路篇：精，禮，准，行，謝 英語郵件的五字方針

在開始正式內容之前，還是希望幫大家提煉一下撰寫英語郵件的要領：

一封好的英語郵件我認為有5個重要標準：

## 1.精：

措辭言簡意賅，篇幅精簡，因為郵件的目的是方便別人閱讀和理解。***（LESS IS MORE）***

## 2.禮：

一定要講禮節，講禮節，講禮節！重要的事情講3遍。外國人非常講究禮貌，這代表一個人的素養，尤其在素未謀面的情況下。**禮貌的態度就是你最好得名片。**

## 3.准：

表達的資訊，觀點要明確。每每都要擊中要害，就如同一顆顆出膛的子彈擊中你所要表達的目的。（[bullet point](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=bullet+point&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A997212532%7D)）抓重點，不要泛泛而談。因為人家沒時間看你的“文章”。

一般重要資訊有，【重要決定】，【[會議紀要](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E4%BC%9A%E8%AE%AE%E7%BA%AA%E8%A6%81&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A997212532%7D)】，【建議&方案】等

一般選取三點比較好，提煉關鍵點。1，2，3，我只說三點

## 4.行：

“行“表示郵件最後要給到下一步的行動計畫，因為光有一個結論沒有action plan等於沒有推動項目的進行。所以給到郵件相關同事，客戶一個清晰的行動計畫，最好用表格的形式呈現為上策。記住，你是一個手握方向盤的老司機，你要drive。開車

## 5.謝：

在郵件最後，表達感謝。希望別人的回復，感謝他人的配合與協作。帶著滿滿都誠意與他人溝通，合作就會變得順暢。讓別人不僅僅知道你的目的，更重要的是你的心意。

希望你通過以上五個bullet point配合我提供的一些模版，還有自己的積累。寫出一封封得體又溫暖的英語郵件。讓你的溝通幫助你贏得生意場上的豐收，獲得公司內部溝通達人的好口碑。

## 第二章：實用篇

## 奉上獨家使用說明書：

***1.保存一個word文檔，需要的話下方有獲取方式***

***2.“查找”你需要的主題或者關鍵字 （CTRL+F）***

***3.複製+粘貼：應該是最喜聞樂見的快速鍵了***

***4.修改潤色：根據你郵件需要表達的意思和語境進行適當的修改***

好句子都在下面了，供大家參考：

補充：

**關於英語郵件中附件的小心得：**

寫郵件時需要集中精力，因為在郵件中的每個字，每句話所傳達的資訊都代表著個人或者公司的立場。所以一定要慎重，反復檢查。附件作為郵件中的關鍵資訊，更是要加以重視。因為，附件一般包含“報價，合同，商務策劃案，文稿”等重要商業資訊。所以，結合以往的工作經驗，給到一些tips。

**1.附件審批：**

若涉及合同，報價等重要檔，一定要先和上級領導提前sign-off，確認內容時準確無誤後再加入到郵件內。

**2.附件的檔案名：**

附件的檔案名記得要針對收件人進行優化，應該具有很強的識別性，好的檔案名是“當對方下載後不需要重命名的”，直接放在資料夾保存。

雖然是很小的一個細節，但是能體現你工作的溫度，你是在為下一個接手的人（同事，客戶）著想的。

**3.發送前檢查**

我在發送線一般都會檢查至少兩遍，一般檢查兩個點：

a.附件是否有被添加，數量是否正確

b.點擊預覽，看檔是否能夠打開

c.再次查看附件的內容，尤其是報價和合同，我會整體再檢查一遍

**4.點擊發送**

自信的點擊發送，耐心等待回復
