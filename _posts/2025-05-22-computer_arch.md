## üî∞ I. Core Computer Architecture Knowledge

This section delves into the fundamental building blocks and operational principles of modern processors.

### 1. Pipeline Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Pipelining is a technique used to improve instruction throughput by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions. Imagine an assembly line where each stage performs a specific task.

- **5-stage and deeper pipelines (fetch, decode, execute, memory, writeback):**

  - **Fetch (F):** Retrieves the next instruction from memory (usually the instruction cache). The Program Counter (PC) holds the address of the instruction.
  - **Decode (D):** Interprets the fetched instruction, identifies the operation to be performed, and determines the source and destination registers. Control signals for subsequent stages are generated here.
  - **Execute (E):** Performs the actual computation (e.g., arithmetic or logical operations by the ALU) or calculates addresses for memory operations.
  - **Memory (M):** Accesses data memory for load or store operations. For non-memory instructions, this stage might be idle or used for other purposes.
  - **Writeback (W):** Writes the result of the execution (from the ALU or data loaded from memory) back to the destination register in the register file.
  - **Deeper Pipelines:** Modern processors often have much deeper pipelines (e.g., 10, 15, 20+ stages). This allows for higher clock frequencies as each stage does less work. However, it also increases the penalty of pipeline flushes due to hazards.

- **Pipeline hazards: data, control, structural:** Hazards are situations that prevent the next instruction in the pipeline from executing during its designated clock cycle.1

  - Data Hazards:

     

    Occur when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that is still in the pipeline and not yet completed.

    - **Read After Write (RAW) / True Dependence:** An instruction tries to read a register before a preceding instruction has written to it. (e.g., `ADD R1, R2, R3` followed by `SUB R4, R1, R5`).
    - **Write After Read (WAR) / Anti-dependence:** An instruction tries to write to a register before a preceding instruction has read from it. This is less common in simple pipelines but can occur with out-of-order execution or complex addressing modes. (e.g., `SUB R4, R1, R5` followed by `ADD R1, R2, R3`).
    - **Write After Write (WAW) / Output Dependence:** Two instructions write to the same location. This can also be an issue in out-of-order execution. (e.g., `ADD R1, R2, R3` followed by `LOAD R1, (R4)`).

  - **Control Hazards (Branch Hazards):** Occur when the pipeline makes a decision about which instruction to fetch next before the outcome of a conditional branch instruction is known. If the branch is taken, the instructions fetched sequentially after the branch are incorrect and must be flushed.

  - **Structural Hazards:** Occur when two or more instructions in the pipeline require the same hardware resource at the same time. For example, if there's only one memory port and two instructions (one in Execute for a load, another in Fetch) try to access memory simultaneously.

- **Forwarding, stalling, and hazard detection logic:** Techniques to handle hazards.

  - **Forwarding (Bypassing):** A hardware mechanism that allows the result of an instruction to be passed directly from its producing stage to the input of a subsequent instruction in an earlier stage, without waiting for it to be written back to the register file. This can resolve many RAW hazards.
  - **Stalling (Pipeline Bubble Insertion):** If forwarding cannot resolve a hazard (e.g., a load-use hazard where data is needed immediately after a load, but the load takes a memory cycle), the pipeline is stalled. This involves inserting "bubbles" (NOPs - No Operations) into the pipeline to delay subsequent instructions until the hazard is cleared.
  - **Hazard Detection Logic:** Hardware units that check for data and control dependencies between instructions currently in the pipeline. This logic determines when to stall or activate forwarding paths.

- **Out-of-order execution (OoOE): ROB, issue logic, reservation stations, Tomasulo‚Äôs algorithm:**

  - **Out-of-Order Execution (OoOE):** A technique that allows instructions to execute in an order different from the program order (the order they are fetched) as long as data dependencies are respected. This improves performance by keeping execution units busy even if some instructions are stalled waiting for data.

  - **Reorder Buffer (ROB):** A hardware buffer that holds the results of instructions that have completed execution but cannot yet be committed (written to the architectural state, like registers or memory) because earlier instructions (in program order) have not yet completed. The ROB ensures that instructions are committed in program order, maintaining precise exceptions.

  - **Issue Logic:** Determines when an instruction can be dispatched from a queue to a functional unit for execution. It checks for the availability of functional units and the readiness of operand data.

  - **Reservation Stations:** Buffers associated with functional units (e.g., ALU, FPU, load/store units). Each reservation station holds an instruction that is waiting for its operands to become available or for the functional unit to be free. Once all operands are ready, the instruction can be issued to the functional unit.

  - Tomasulo‚Äôs Algorithm:

     

    A specific hardware algorithm for dynamic instruction scheduling that enables out-of-order execution. Key features include:

    - **Register Renaming:** Reservation stations use tags to refer to registers, effectively renaming them to avoid WAR and WAW hazards. When an instruction is issued, its destination register is assigned a tag, and subsequent instructions that need this result will wait for the tag to be broadcast on a Common Data Bus (CDB).
    - **Common Data Bus (CDB):** A bus that broadcasts results from functional units to reservation stations and the ROB. This allows waiting instructions to capture needed operands as soon as they are available.

- **Superscalar vs VLIW:**

  - **Superscalar Architecture:** A processor that can issue and execute multiple instructions per clock cycle by having multiple parallel execution units (e.g., multiple ALUs, FPUs). The hardware dynamically finds independent instructions to execute in parallel from a conventional instruction stream. Complexity lies in the hardware issue logic.
  - **Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) Architecture:** A processor where the compiler packs multiple independent operations (opcodes) into a single very long instruction word. Each operation within the VLIW is dispatched to a specific functional unit. The parallelism is explicitly determined by the compiler, simplifying the hardware issue logic but placing a heavy burden on the compiler to find and schedule parallelism. If the compiler cannot fill all slots, they are often padded with NOPs, potentially leading to code bloat.

### 2. Cache & Memory Hierarchy üíæ

A system of multiple levels of memory with different speeds and sizes, designed to bridge the speed gap between the fast processor and slow main memory.

- **Cache types: direct-mapped, set-associative, fully associative:**

  - **Cache:** A small, fast memory that stores copies of frequently accessed data from main memory.
  - **Direct-Mapped Cache:** Each memory block can only map to one specific cache line (location). This is determined by the block's address (typically using the modulo operator: `cache line = memory block address MOD number of cache lines`). Simple to implement but can suffer from high conflict misses if multiple frequently used blocks map to the same line.
  - **Set-Associative Cache:** Memory blocks can map to a small set of cache lines (e.g., 2-way, 4-way, 8-way set associative). A memory block's address determines the set, and the block can be placed in any of the lines within that set. This reduces conflict misses compared to direct-mapped caches. For an N-way set associative cache, there are N possible locations for a given block within its assigned set.
  - **Fully Associative Cache:** A memory block can be placed in any cache line. This offers the most flexibility and the lowest conflict miss rate but is the most complex and expensive to implement due to the need to compare the incoming address with all tags in the cache simultaneously (using Content Addressable Memory - CAM). Often used for very small caches like TLBs.

- **Cache policies: LRU, pseudo-LRU, write-back vs write-through:**

  - Replacement Policies (when a cache set is full and a new block needs to be brought in):
    - **Least Recently Used (LRU):** Replaces the cache line that has not been accessed for the longest time. Provides good performance but can be complex to implement perfectly for highly associative caches (requires tracking access order).
    - **Pseudo-LRU (PLRU):** Approximations of LRU that are simpler to implement in hardware, often using a few bits per set to track usage. Examples include tree-PLRU or not-most-recently-used.
    - **Other policies:** Random, FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LFU (Least Frequently Used).
  - Write Policies (how writes to the cache are handled with respect to main memory):
    - **Write-Through:** Writes are immediately propagated to both the cache and the main memory. This keeps memory consistent but can create a write bottleneck and consume more memory bandwidth. Often used with a write buffer to hide latency.
    - **Write-Back (Write-Deferred):** Writes are only made to the cache. The modified cache line (now "dirty") is written back to main memory only when it is replaced or explicitly flushed. This reduces memory bandwidth usage and is generally faster, but it complicates cache coherence. A "dirty bit" is used for each cache line to track if it has been modified.

- **Cache coherence protocols: MESI, MOESI, directory-based coherence:** Ensure that all processors in a multiprocessor system have a consistent view of memory.

  - Snooping Protocols (for bus-based systems):

     

    Cache controllers monitor (snoop) the shared bus for memory transactions from other caches.

    - MESI (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid):

       

      A common invalidation-based cache coherence protocol. Each cache line is in one of four states:

      - **Modified (M):** The line is present only in the current cache, is dirty (modified), and its value in main memory is stale. The cache must write it back to memory before allowing other caches to read it.
      - **Exclusive (E):** The line is present only in the current cache, is clean (not modified), and matches main memory. The cache can write to it locally without informing other caches, transitioning to the Modified state.
      - **Shared (S):** The line is present in this cache and at least one other cache, is clean, and matches main memory. The cache cannot write to it without first invalidating other copies.
      - **Invalid (I):** The line does not contain valid data.

    - MOESI (Modified, Owned, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid):

       

      An enhancement of MESI that adds an "Owned" state.

      - **Owned (O):** The line is present in this cache and potentially others, is dirty, but main memory is stale. This cache "owns" the block and is responsible for providing the data to other caches that request it (cache-to-cache transfer) and eventually writing it back to memory. This can reduce write-back traffic to main memory.

  - **Directory-Based Coherence (for scalable, non-bus-based systems like NoCs):** A centralized or distributed directory keeps track of which caches have copies of which memory blocks and their states. Instead of snooping, caches send requests to the directory, which then coordinates coherence actions (e.g., sending invalidations or forwarding data). More scalable than snooping for a large number of processors.

- **Virtual memory: page tables, TLBs, page faults, address translation:**

  - **Virtual Memory:** A memory management technique that provides an application with the illusion of a larger, contiguous address space (virtual address space) than the physically available memory (physical address space). It allows multiple processes to have their own private address spaces.

  - **Page Tables:** Data structures maintained by the operating system that map virtual addresses to physical addresses. Each process typically has its own page table. They are stored in main memory and can be multi-level to save space for large address spaces. Each entry in a page table is a Page Table Entry (PTE), containing the physical frame number, present bit, dirty bit, protection bits, etc.

  - **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB):** A specialized, fast cache that stores recent virtual-to-physical address translations (PTEs). When the CPU generates a virtual address, it first checks the TLB. If a TLB hit occurs, the physical address is obtained quickly. If a TLB miss occurs, a page table walk (hardware or software-assisted) is performed to fetch the PTE from main memory, and the translation is then stored in the TLB.

  - Page Fault:

     

    An event that occurs when a program tries to access a page that is not currently mapped into physical memory (its present bit in the PTE is clear). The hardware traps to the operating system, which then:

    1. Finds a free physical frame (or evicts another page to make space).
    2. Loads the required page from disk into the physical frame.
    3. Updates the page table entry.
    4. Restarts the instruction that caused the fault.

  - Address Translation:

     

    The process of converting a virtual address generated by the CPU into a physical address used to access main memory. This involves:

    1. Splitting the virtual address into a Virtual Page Number (VPN) and an offset.
    2. Using the VPN to index the TLB.
    3. **TLB Hit:** If the VPN is found, the corresponding Physical Frame Number (PFN) is retrieved, concatenated with the offset to form the physical address.
    4. **TLB Miss:** If the VPN is not found, a page table walk is initiated using the VPN to access the page table(s) in memory to find the PTE. Once found, the PFN is used, and the translation is usually cached in the TLB.

- **Prefetching: stream buffers, stride detection:** Techniques to bring data into the cache before it is explicitly requested by the processor, aiming to hide memory latency.

  - **Stream Buffers:** Small FIFO buffers that detect sequential memory access patterns (streams). When a miss occurs for address X, the stream buffer prefetches blocks X+1, X+2, etc., into the buffer or directly into the cache.
  - **Stride Detection:** A more general prefetching mechanism that detects accesses with a constant stride (e.g., accessing every 4th element in an array). If accesses A, A+S, A+2S are detected, the prefetcher will fetch A+3S, A+4S, etc.
  - **Other prefetchers:** Hardware prefetchers can be quite sophisticated, looking at instruction addresses (PC-based prefetching) or using more complex pattern detectors. Software prefetching involves the compiler or programmer inserting explicit prefetch instructions.

- **DRAM organization: banks, rows, columns, page hits/misses:**

  - **Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM):** The main type of memory used for system RAM. Stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor within an integrated circuit. Requires periodic refreshing.
  - **Banks:** Modern DRAM chips are divided into multiple independent banks. This allows operations to be interleaved between banks, improving parallelism and bandwidth. Accessing different banks can often overlap.
  - **Rows and Columns:** Within each bank, memory cells are organized in a 2D array of rows and columns.
  - Accessing DRAM:
    1. **Activate (Row Access):** To access data, a specific row in a specific bank must first be "opened" or "activated." This involves reading the entire row into a row buffer (sense amplifiers) within that bank. This is a relatively slow operation (RAS to CAS delay - tRCD).
    2. **Column Access (Read/Write):** Once a row is open in the row buffer, multiple column accesses (reads or writes) can be performed relatively quickly to different locations within that row. This is controlled by the Column Address Strobe (CAS).
    3. **Precharge:** After access to a row is complete, the bank must be "precharged" to close the current row before a different row in the same bank can be activated.
  - DRAM Page Mode / Page Hits/Misses (Row Buffer Hits/Misses):
    - **Page Hit (Row Buffer Hit):** If the next access is to the same open row in a bank, the data can be accessed quickly from the row buffer. This is a "DRAM page hit."
    - **Page Miss (Row Buffer Miss / Conflict):** If the next access is to a different row in the same bank, the current row must be precharged, and the new row activated. This incurs significant latency.
    - **Page Empty (Row Buffer Empty):** If the next access is to a bank with no currently open row, a row must be activated.
  - Memory controllers try to schedule requests to maximize row buffer hits and utilize bank-level parallelism.

### 3. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) üìú

The interface between the hardware and the software, defining the instructions, registers, addressing modes, and data types that the processor can understand and execute.

- **RISC vs CISC, RISC-V familiarity is a plus:**

  - Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC):

    - Features a large number of instructions, some of which can perform complex operations (e.g., a single instruction might load from memory, perform an arithmetic operation, and store to memory).
    - Instructions can have variable lengths and multiple addressing modes.
    - Aims to make compiler writing easier and reduce the number of instructions per program.
    - Examples: Intel x86, Motorola 68k.
    - Often implemented using microcode, where complex instructions are broken down into simpler micro-operations internally.

  - Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC):

    - Features a small, highly optimized set of instructions.
    - Instructions are typically fixed-length and have regular formats.
    - Emphasizes a load-store architecture (only load and store instructions access memory; ALU operations work on registers).
    - Aims for simpler, faster hardware and easier pipelining. Relies more on the compiler to optimize instruction sequences.
    - Examples: ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, RISC-V.

  - RISC-V:

     

    A modern, open-source ISA.

    - **Modular Design:** Base integer ISA with optional standard extensions (e.g., M for integer multiplication/division, A for atomics, F/D for floating-point, C for compressed instructions, V for vector extensions).
    - **Simplicity and Extensibility:** Designed to be easy to implement and extend for custom purposes.
    - Gaining popularity in academia and industry for its openness and flexibility.

- **Instruction formats, control signals, micro-op fusion:**

  - **Instruction Formats:** The layout of bits within an instruction, specifying the opcode (operation to perform), source and destination register fields, immediate values, and addressing mode information. RISC ISAs typically have a few fixed-length formats, while CISC ISAs can have many variable-length formats.

  - **Control Signals:** Signals generated by the control unit (typically in the decode stage) that direct the operation of the datapath components (ALU, register file, memory interface, multiplexers) to execute the instruction.

  - Micro-operation (Œºop or uop) Fusion:

     

    A technique used primarily in modern CISC processors (like x86) that are internally RISC-like (micro-ops). The decoder translates complex CISC instructions into simpler RISC-like micro-ops.

    - **Macro-fusion:** Fuses two related macro-instructions (like a compare followed by a conditional branch) into a single micro-op or a tightly coupled pair of micro-ops.
    - **Micro-fusion:** Fuses multiple micro-ops resulting from a single macro-instruction into fewer, more complex micro-ops that can be executed by a single execution unit. For example, a load-and-operate instruction might be decoded into a load Œºop and an ALU Œºop, which could then be fused if the hardware supports it. This can improve instruction throughput and reduce power.

- **SIMD, vector extensions (e.g., AVX, NEON, SVE):**

  - **Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD):** A form of parallelism where a single instruction operates on multiple data elements simultaneously. This is achieved by having wider registers that can hold multiple data elements (e.g., four 32-bit integers in a 128-bit register) and execution units that can perform parallel operations on these elements.

  - Vector Extensions:

     

    Specific ISA extensions that provide SIMD capabilities.

    - **AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions):** Intel/AMD extension for x86, supporting 128-bit, 256-bit (AVX2), and 512-bit (AVX-512) vector operations on floating-point and integer data.
    - **NEON:** ARM's advanced SIMD architecture extension, typically supporting 64-bit and 128-bit registers for operations on various data types (integer, floating-point).
    - **SVE (Scalable Vector Extension):** ARM's newer vector extension, designed to be vector length agnostic. Software can be written to adapt to different hardware vector lengths (from 128 bits to 2048 bits, in 128-bit increments) without recompilation. Introduces concepts like predicated execution for vectors.

- **Load-store architectures, addressing modes:**

  - **Load-Store Architecture:** A key characteristic of RISC ISAs. Only explicit load (memory to register) and store (register to memory) instructions can access memory. All other operations (arithmetic, logical) operate on data held in registers. This simplifies instruction design and pipelining.

  - Addressing Modes:

     

    Define how the effective memory address for a load or store instruction (or the target address for a branch) is calculated. Common modes include:

    - **Immediate:** The operand is a constant value embedded in the instruction itself.
    - **Register Direct:** The operand is the content of a CPU register.
    - **Register Indirect:** The effective address is the content of a CPU register. (e.g., `Load R1, (R2)`means load into R1 from address in R2).
    - **Displacement (Base + Offset):** Effective address = content of a base register + a constant offset (displacement) specified in the instruction. (e.g., `Load R1, 100(R2)`).
    - **Indexed:** Effective address = content of a base register + content of an index register.
    - **Scaled Indexed:** Effective address = content of a base register + (content of an index register * scale factor) + displacement. Useful for array access.
    - **PC-Relative:** Effective address = Program Counter + offset. Used for branches and accessing data near the current instruction.

------

### 4. Branch Prediction üéØ

Techniques used to guess the outcome (taken or not-taken) and target address of branch instructions before they are fully executed, to avoid stalling the pipeline.

- **Static vs dynamic prediction:**

  - Static Branch Prediction:

     

    Predictions are made based on fixed rules or information available at compile time, without using runtime history.

    - **Examples:** Always predict taken, always predict not-taken, predict backward branches taken (good for loops), predict forward branches not-taken (good for if-then constructs), compiler hints (profile-guided optimization).
    - Simple but less accurate than dynamic prediction.

  - Dynamic Branch Prediction:

     

    Predictions are made at runtime based on the past behavior (history) of branches. Hardware structures store this history.

    - More complex but significantly more accurate.

- **Gshare, tournament predictors:** Sophisticated dynamic branch predictors.

  - **Branch History Table (BHT):** A small cache indexed by bits from the branch instruction's address. Each entry typically contains one or more bits representing the recent history of the branch (e.g., a 2-bit saturating counter per branch to store one of four states: strongly not-taken, weakly not-taken, weakly taken, strongly taken).

  - Gshare (Global Share / GAg - Global Address Global history):

     

    A popular and effective predictor that combines global branch history with the branch address.

    - It typically uses a global history register (GHR) which is a shift register recording the outcomes (taken/not-taken) of the last N branches executed globally across the program.
    - The branch address (or parts of it) is XORed with the GHR to form an index into a Pattern History Table (PHT), which contains 2-bit saturating counters.
    - The idea is that the behavior of a branch can be correlated with the behavior of recently executed branches.

  - **Tournament Predictors (Hybrid Predictors):** Combine multiple different prediction schemes (e.g., a local predictor that uses per-branch history and a global predictor like Gshare) and use a meta-predictor (chooser) to select which predictor's output to use for a given branch. The meta-predictor learns which underlying predictor is more accurate for specific branches or under certain conditions. This often yields higher accuracy than any single component predictor.

- **BTB (Branch Target Buffer), RAS (Return Address Stack):**

  - Branch Target Buffer (BTB):

     

    A cache that stores the target addresses of recently executed taken branches, indexed by the branch instruction's address.

    - When a branch instruction is fetched, the BTB is accessed. If there's a hit and the branch is predicted taken (by a separate predictor or a prediction stored in the BTB entry), the BTB provides the target address, allowing the pipeline to start fetching from the target path immediately, even before the branch is decoded or executed.
    - Reduces the "bubble" caused by a taken branch from 3 cycles (e.g., in a 5-stage pipeline, if target known at end of Execute) to potentially 0 or 1 cycle.

  - Return Address Stack (RAS):

     

    A small hardware stack used to predict the target addresses of

     

    ```
    return
    ```

    instructions from procedure/function calls.

    - When a `call` instruction is executed, the return address (PC+instruction_size) is pushed onto the RAS.
    - When a `return` instruction is encountered, the address at the top of the RAS is popped and used as the predicted target address.
    - Very effective for accurately predicting return addresses, as calls and returns are typically well-nested.

- **Impact of misprediction on pipeline performance:**

  - When a branch is mispredicted, all instructions fetched and partially executed along the incorrect path must be flushed from the pipeline.
  - The pipeline then has to fetch instructions from the correct path, starting from the branch target (if taken) or the sequential instruction (if not-taken).
  - **Misprediction Penalty:** The number of clock cycles lost due to a branch misprediction. This penalty is proportional to the depth of the pipeline (specifically, the number of stages from fetch to the point where the branch outcome is resolved). For a deep pipeline, this penalty can be significant (e.g., 10-20+ cycles).
  - `CPI_effective = CPI_ideal + (Branch Frequency * Misprediction Rate * Misprediction Penalty)`
  - High misprediction rates can severely degrade performance, making accurate branch prediction crucial, especially in deep and wide superscalar processors.

### 5. Multicore & Parallelism üîÑ

Techniques and architectures for executing multiple tasks or parts of a task concurrently.

- **Multithreading: SMT, fine/coarse-grained:** Techniques to allow a single processor core to execute multiple threads of control concurrently, improving resource utilization.

  - **Thread:** A lightweight process or an independent sequence of instructions.

  - **Fine-Grained Multithreading:** The processor switches between threads on a cycle-by-cycle basis (e.g., round-robin). Can hide short latencies (e.g., cache misses) as another thread can execute while one is stalled. Can slow down individual thread execution if too many threads share resources.

  - **Coarse-Grained Multithreading:** The processor executes instructions from one thread until a long-latency event occurs (e.g., a last-level cache miss). Then, it switches to another thread. Simpler to implement than fine-grained but less effective at hiding short latencies. Pipeline flush costs are incurred on a switch.

  - Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT):

     

    A form of hardware multithreading that allows multiple threads to issue instructions to a superscalar processor's multiple execution units in the same clock cycle. It leverages the typically underutilized execution units within a wide superscalar core by finding instruction-level parallelism across multiple threads.

    - Threads share most core resources (caches, execution units, ROB, etc.) but have separate architectural states (PC, registers).
    - Intel's Hyper-Threading is a well-known example of SMT.
    - Can improve throughput significantly but can also lead to resource contention between threads (e.g., for cache space or execution units).

- **Memory consistency models: SC, TSO, release consistency:** Define the order in which memory operations (reads and writes) from one processor appear to be observed by other processors in a shared-memory multiprocessor system. This is crucial for correct parallel programming.

  - **Sequential Consistency (SC):** The most intuitive and strictest model. The result of any execution is the same as if the operations of all processors were executed in some sequential order, and the operations of each individual processor appear in this sequence2 in the order specified by its program. All processors see the same global order of memory operations. Difficult to implement efficiently in hardware.

  - **Total Store Order (TSO):** A weaker model used by processors like SPARC and x86 (in its common operating mode). It allows a processor's writes to be buffered (in a store buffer) and not immediately visible to other processors. Reads, however, cannot be reordered with respect to other reads or older writes from the same processor. A processor can read its own writes before they are visible to others. Memory barriers (fences) are needed to enforce stricter ordering when required.

  - Relaxed Consistency Models (e.g., Release Consistency - RC, Weak Ordering - WO):

     

    Offer even more freedom for reordering memory operations, potentially improving performance. They distinguish between ordinary memory accesses and synchronization accesses (e.g., acquire and release operations for locks).

    - **Release Consistency (RC):** Ensures that all previous memory operations by a processor are completed and visible to other processors before a 'release' synchronization operation (e.g., unlocking a mutex) completes. An 'acquire' operation (e.g., locking a mutex) ensures that memory operations following it will see writes from other processors that occurred before the corresponding release. Between synchronization operations, reordering is more permissible.

  - Programmers need to be aware of the consistency model of the target architecture and use appropriate synchronization primitives (locks, barriers, fences) to ensure correctness.

- **Cache coherence in multi-core systems:** As discussed in section I.2 (MESI, MOESI, Directory-based), ensuring that all cores have a consistent view of shared memory when they have private caches. This is fundamental for the correctness of parallel programs running on multicore processors. Without coherence, one core might read stale data from its cache that another core has already updated.

- **Interconnects: buses, rings, meshes, NoCs:** The communication infrastructure that connects different components within a chip (e.g., cores, caches, memory controllers) or between chips.

  - **Bus:** A shared communication pathway. Simple and cost-effective for a small number of components. Becomes a bottleneck as the number of components increases due to contention and limited bandwidth. Snooping cache coherence protocols are often used with buses.
  - **Ring:** Components are connected in a circular fashion. Data travels around the ring from source to destination. Offers better bandwidth than a simple bus for a moderate number of components and can support pipelined transfers. Unidirectional or bidirectional. Latency can be an issue for distant nodes.
  - **Mesh:** Components are arranged in a grid (2D or 3D), and each component is connected to its neighbors. Offers good scalability, high bisection bandwidth, and fault tolerance (multiple paths exist). Routing can be complex. Common in many-core processors.
  - **Network-on-Chip (NoC):** A general approach to designing on-chip communication systems using network theory. Comprises routers and links, allowing packet-based communication between IP (Intellectual Property) blocks (cores, memory, accelerators). Can be implemented with various topologies (mesh, torus, fat tree, etc.). Highly scalable and flexible, often used in complex SoCs and many-core systems. Directory-based coherence is often used with NoCs.

## üß† II. Performance Analysis and Tradeoffs

Understanding how well a system performs and the design choices that influence its efficiency.

### 1. CPI Breakdown and Amdahl‚Äôs Law üìä

- **CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) Breakdown:**

  - CPI is a measure of processor performance: the average number of clock cycles required to execute one instruction for a given program or program segment.

  - `Execution Time = Instruction Count (IC) * CPI * Clock Cycle Time`

  - **CPI Breakdown** involves attributing portions of the total CPI to different causes or components, helping to identify bottlenecks.

  - ```
    CPI_total = CPI_base + CPI_stalls
    ```

    - **`CPI_base` (or `CPI_ideal`):** The CPI if the pipeline were perfect, with no stalls (e.g., 1 for a simple scalar pipeline if one instruction completes per cycle). For a superscalar processor, `CPI_base`could be less than 1 (e.g., 0.5 if it can sustain 2 instructions per cycle).

    - `CPI_stalls`:

       

      The average number of stall cycles per instruction due to various hazards and latencies. This can be further broken down:

      - `CPI_data_hazard_stalls`: Stalls due to data dependencies (e.g., load-use stalls).

      - `CPI_control_hazard_stalls`: Stalls due to branch mispredictions (penalty cycles).

      - `CPI_structural_hazard_stalls`: Stalls due to resource conflicts.

      - ```
        CPI_memory_stalls
        ```

        : Stalls due to cache misses (L1 miss, L2 miss, main memory access latency). This often dominates

         

        ```
        CPI_stalls
        ```

        .

        - `CPI_memory_stalls = (L1 Miss Rate * L1 Miss Penalty) + (L2 Miss Rate * L2 Miss Penalty) + ...` (where miss rates are per instruction, and penalties are in cycles).

  - Analyzing the CPI breakdown helps architects focus optimization efforts on the most significant contributors to performance loss.

- **Amdahl‚Äôs Law:** A formula used to find the maximum expected improvement to an overall system when only part of the system is improved. It states that the3 performance improvement to be gained from using some faster mode of execution is limited by the fraction of the time the faster mode can be used.4

  - Let `F` be the fraction of execution time that can be enhanced by an improvement (e.g., the fraction of time spent on parallelizable code).
  - Let `S` be the speedup factor for that enhanced portion (e.g., if a part is made 2x faster, S=2).
  - The overall speedup `Speedup_overall` is given by: Speedupoverall=(1‚àíF)+SF1
  - **Key Implication:** There's a limit to the speedup achievable. If a portion `F` is sped up infinitely (`S` ‚Üí ‚àû), the maximum speedup is `1 / (1 - F)`. For example, if 50% of a task can be parallelized (`F=0.5`), even with an infinite number of processors for that part (`S`=‚àû), the maximum overall speedup is `1 / (1 - 0.5) = 2x`.
  - It highlights the importance of optimizing the "common case" or the parts of the system that consume the most time. It also shows that the serial portion of a program (1-F) will eventually limit scalability.

- **Understanding Bottlenecks:**

  - A bottleneck is a component or resource that limits the overall performance of the system.
  - CPI breakdown helps identify pipeline or memory system bottlenecks.
  - Amdahl's Law helps understand how much impact improving a specific bottleneck will have on overall performance.
  - Examples: A high `CPI_memory_stalls` indicates a memory bottleneck. A high `CPI_control_hazard_stalls` indicates a branch prediction bottleneck. If a particular functional unit is always busy while others are idle, it's a structural bottleneck.

- **Tradeoff Analysis: Power, Performance, Area (PPA):**

  - These are three critical and often conflicting design metrics for integrated circuits.

  - **Performance (P):** How fast a task can be completed (e.g., execution time, throughput, clock frequency, IPC - Instructions Per Cycle).

  - Power (P):

     

    The amount of electrical energy consumed by the chip per unit time. Consists of dynamic power (switching activity) and static power (leakage).

    - `Dynamic Power ‚âà C * V^2 * f * A` (Capacitance, Voltage, frequency, Activity factor)
    - `Static Power ‚âà I_leakage * V`

  - **Area (A):** The physical silicon area occupied by the design. Directly impacts manufacturing cost and yield.

  - Tradeoffs:

    - Increasing performance (e.g., by adding more execution units, deeper pipelines, larger caches, higher frequency) usually increases area and power consumption.
    - Aggressive pipelining increases frequency (good for performance) but also increases latch overhead (area, power) and misprediction penalty.
    - Larger caches improve hit rates (performance) but increase area, access latency (potentially impacting clock cycle), and static power.
    - Out-of-order execution improves IPC (performance) but requires complex logic (ROB, reservation stations), significantly increasing area and power.
    - Lowering voltage (DVFS) reduces power quadratically but also reduces maximum operating frequency (performance).

  - Designers must make informed choices to balance these factors based on the target application and market (e.g., high-performance servers vs. low-power mobile devices).

- **Energy Efficiency (Perf/Watt):**

  - A crucial metric, especially for battery-powered devices and large data centers (where energy cost is significant).
  - Measures the amount of useful work done per unit of energy consumed.
  - `Energy = Power * Time`
  - `Perf/Watt = Performance / Power`
  - Often, the most power-efficient design is not the highest peak performance design, nor the lowest power design. It's about achieving a good balance.
  - Techniques like DVFS, clock gating, and power gating aim to improve energy efficiency by reducing power during idle or less demanding periods.

### 2. Benchmarking and Profiling ‚è±Ô∏è

Methods to measure, analyze, and understand system performance.

- **Use of tools (e.g., perf, VTune, gem5, custom trace analysis):**

  - Benchmarking:

     

    Running standardized programs (benchmarks) or representative workloads on a system to evaluate its performance.

    - **Benchmark Suites:** Collections of programs designed to test various aspects of performance (e.g., SPEC CPU for processor performance, SPEC Power for energy efficiency, MLPerf for machine learning).
    - Results are often reported as a single number or a set of metrics that can be compared across different systems or configurations.

  - **Profiling:** Analyzing the runtime behavior of a program to identify performance bottlenecks, hot spots (frequently executed code sections), memory access patterns, cache utilization, etc.

  - Tools:

    - **`perf` (Linux):** A powerful command-line profiling tool for Linux. Uses hardware performance counters and software event tracing. Can profile CPU utilization, cache misses, branch mispredictions, system calls, etc., at system-wide or per-process levels. Supports sampling and event counting.

    - **Intel VTune Profiler (formerly VTune Amplifier):** A performance analysis tool primarily for Intel platforms. Provides rich visualization and analysis of hotspots, threading, memory access, microarchitecture bottlenecks, I/O, etc. Uses hardware event-based sampling.

    - Architectural Simulators (e.g., gem5, Simics, MARSSx86 - covered later):

       

      These tools simulate a computer system at various levels of detail. They are invaluable for:

      - **Design Space Exploration:** Evaluating architectural tradeoffs before hardware is built.
      - **Detailed Performance Analysis:** Providing insights not easily obtainable from real hardware (e.g., precise state of caches, pipeline stages, contention for specific resources).
      - `gem5` is a popular open-source, modular, cycle-accurate simulator.

    - Custom Trace Analysis:

      - **Trace:** A log of events that occurred during program execution (e.g., instruction trace, memory access trace, branch trace).
      - Traces can be generated by simulators, hardware (e.g., Intel Processor Trace), or instrumentation.
      - Custom scripts (often in Python) are written to parse these traces and extract specific statistics or patterns (e.g., cache miss rates for different access patterns, data dependency distances, branch behavior).

- **Reading and interpreting performance counters:**

  - **Performance Monitoring Units (PMUs) / Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs):** Special hardware registers within a processor that can count various architectural and microarchitectural events.

  - Common Events Counted:

    - Instructions retired (executed)
    - Clock cycles
    - Cache misses (L1D, L1I, L2, LLC)
    - Cache hits
    - TLB misses
    - Branch instructions retired
    - Branch mispredictions retired
    - Memory accesses
    - Floating-point operations
    - Stall cycles (due to various reasons)
    - Resource utilization (e.g., specific execution units)

  - Interpretation:

    - Ratios:

       

      Often more insightful than raw counts.

      - `IPC = Instructions Retired / Clock Cycles` (higher is better)
      - `L1 Miss Rate = L1 Misses / L1 Accesses` (lower is better)
      - `Branch Misprediction Rate = Branch Mispredictions / Branch Instructions` (lower is better)

    - **Correlation:** Correlating different counter values can reveal bottlenecks. For example, high L2 cache misses along with high stall cycles might indicate that memory latency is a major performance limiter.

    - **Context is Key:** The "good" or "bad" value for a counter depends heavily on the specific architecture, workload, and what is being optimized.

    - **Overhead and Accuracy:** Sampling with PMUs can have some overhead. Multiplexing of counters (when there are more events to monitor than available physical counters) can lead to statistical inaccuracies if not handled carefully.

    - Tools like `perf` and VTune provide user-friendly interfaces to access and interpret PMU data.

## üíª III. RTL / Digital Design (if role involves microarchitecture)

This section focuses on the skills needed to implement digital logic, particularly for those involved in designing the low-level details of a processor's hardware.

### 1. Verilog / VHDL üí°

Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) used to describe the structure and behavior of digital electronic circuits.

- **Writing synthesizable RTL (Register Transfer Level):**

  - **RTL:** A level of abstraction for describing a digital circuit in terms of how data is transformed and moved between registers and through combinational logic.
  - **Synthesizable Code:** HDL code written in a way that synthesis tools can understand and automatically convert into a netlist of logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, flip-flops) that implement the described hardware.
  - Key Principles for Synthesizable RTL:
    - **Describe Hardware:** Think in terms of hardware structures (registers, multiplexers, adders, state machines) rather than software programming constructs.
    - **Clocking:** Clearly define synchronous elements (registers) and how they are clocked.
    - **Reset:** Provide a clear reset mechanism for sequential elements.
    - **Avoid Non-Synthesizable Constructs:** HDLs have constructs useful for simulation (e.g., delays like `#10`, `initial` blocks with non-constant assignments for synthesis, `fork-join` in Verilog for behavioral simulation) that cannot be directly translated into physical gates. Some `system tasks`(like `$display`) are also non-synthesizable.
    - **Inferable Logic:** Write code from which synthesis tools can infer standard logic structures. For example, an `if-else` or `case` statement within a combinational `always` block typically infers multiplexers.

- **FSM design, ALU, register files:** Common digital building blocks.

  - Finite State Machine (FSM):

     

    A circuit that has a set of states and transitions between those states based on inputs and current state. Used for control logic.

    - **Components:** State register (stores current state), next-state logic (combinational logic to determine the next state), output logic (combinational logic to determine outputs based on current state and/or inputs).

    - Types:

      - **Moore FSM:** Outputs depend only on the current state.
      - **Mealy FSM:** Outputs depend on the current state and current inputs.

    - HDL Implementation:

       

      Typically involves:

      1. State encoding (e.g., binary, one-hot).
      2. A clocked `always` block (or `process` in VHDL) for the state register.
      3. A combinational `always` block (or `process`) for next-state logic and output logic (for Mealy) or just next-state logic (with output logic separate or in the state register block for Moore).

  - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):

     

    A digital circuit that performs arithmetic (add, subtract, increment, decrement) and bitwise logic operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) on integer binary numbers.

    - **Inputs:** Two operands (A, B), an opcode or function select signal.
    - **Outputs:** Result, status flags (e.g., Zero, Carry, Overflow, Negative).
    - **HDL Implementation:** Typically uses a `case` statement (based on the opcode) within a combinational block to select the operation and compute the result.

  - Register File:

     

    A collection of registers that can be accessed by specifying a register number (address). Core component of a CPU for storing temporary data.

    - **Operations:** Read one or more registers simultaneously, write to a specified register.
    - **Ports:** Typically has read ports (e.g., two for a typical RISC pipeline) and a write port. Each read port has a read address input and a data output. The write port has a write address input, write data input, and a write enable signal.
    - HDL Implementation:
      - Memory array: `reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] mem [NUM_REGISTERS-1:0];` (Verilog)
      - Write logic: In a clocked `always` block, sensitive to the clock edge, if write enable is active, data is written to `mem[write_address]`.
      - Read logic: Combinational. `assign read_data_A = mem[read_address_A];` (For synchronous reads, outputs are registered).

- **Blocking vs non-blocking, `always_ff` / `always_comb`:**

  - Blocking Assignments (`=` in Verilog):

    - Executed sequentially in the order they appear within a procedural block (e.g., `always` block).
    - The next statement is not executed until the current one is complete.
    - **Use Case:** Typically used for modeling combinational logic where order matters for intermediate variable assignments within the *same* block, or for modeling sequences in testbenches. **Generally avoid for sequential logic (flip-flops) as it can lead to simulation vs. synthesis mismatches and race conditions if not used carefully.**

  - Non-Blocking Assignments (`<=` in Verilog):

    - All Right-Hand Sides (RHS) are evaluated first, and then assignments to Left-Hand Sides (LHS) are scheduled to occur at the end of the current simulation time step (or on the clock edge for clocked blocks).
    - Order within the block does not affect the final outcome for assignments scheduled for the same event (like a clock edge).
    - **Use Case:** **The standard way to model synchronous sequential logic (flip-flops and registers)**. Also used for modeling concurrent data transfers. This behavior closely matches how hardware registers update simultaneously on a clock edge.
    - Example for a flip-flop: `always @(posedge clk) q <= d;`

  - SystemVerilog `always_ff`, `always_comb`, `always_latch`:

     

    These provide more explicit intent to synthesis tools and for linters/checkers.

    - `always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n)`:
      - Indicates that the block is intended to model **f**lip-**f**lops (sequential logic).
      - Synthesis tools will enforce that only synthesizable sequential logic constructs are used. The sensitivity list is also more rigorously checked (e.g., must contain a clock and optional asynchronous reset).
    - `always_comb`:
      - Indicates that the block is intended to model **comb**inational logic.
      - The sensitivity list is implicitly `*` (all RHS variables). The simulator and synthesis tools will flag if the logic is not truly combinational (e.g., if it infers a latch due to incomplete assignment in an `if` or `case` statement without a `default`).
    - `always_latch`:
      - Indicates that the block is intended to model a transparent **latch**.
      - Used when latches are intentionally designed (though often discouraged in favor of flip-flops in synchronous designs unless specifically needed). The sensitivity list and logic are checked for proper latch inference.

------

### 2. Timing & Constraints ‚è≥

Ensuring that the digital circuit operates correctly at the desired clock speed.

- **Setup/hold time, slack, timing closure:**

  - **Setup Time (`t_su`):** The minimum amount of time that the data input to a sequential element (like a flip-flop) must be stable *before* the active clock edge arrives. If data changes too close to the clock edge, the flip-flop might not capture the correct value or go metastable.

  - **Hold Time (`t_h`):** The minimum amount of time that the data input to a sequential element must remain stable *after* the active clock edge has passed. If data changes too soon after the clock edge, the flip-flop might capture the wrong value.

  - **Clock-to-Q Delay (`t_cq` or `t_co`):** The time it takes for the output (Q) of a flip-flop to change after the active clock edge.

  - **Combinational Logic Delay (`t_comb`):** The propagation delay through a path of combinational logic gates.

  - Slack:

     

    The difference between the required time for a signal to arrive and its actual arrival time.

    - Setup Slack:

       

      ```
      Required Arrival Time (for setup) - Actual Arrival Time
      ```

      . Positive slack means the setup timing constraint is met. Negative slack means a setup violation (data arrives too late).

      - `Required Arrival Time (for setup) = Clock Period - Setup Time (of capturing FF)` (considering a path from one FF to another).
      - `Actual Arrival Time = Clock-to-Q (of launching FF) + Combinational Logic Delay`

    - Hold Slack:

       

      ```
      Actual Arrival Time (of data) - Required Arrival Time (for hold)
      ```

      . Positive slack means the hold timing constraint is met. Negative slack means a hold violation (data changes too soon after clock edge).

      - `Required Arrival Time (for hold) = Hold Time (of capturing FF)`
      - `Actual Arrival Time = Clock-to-Q (of launching FF) + Combinational Logic Delay` (but for hold, often concerned with minimum path delays).

  - **Timing Closure:** The process of iterating on a design (modifying RTL, synthesis settings, placement, routing) until all timing constraints (setup, hold, clock skew, etc.) are met for the target operating frequency. This is a major challenge in modern high-speed designs.

- **Critical Path Analysis:**

  - **Critical Path:** The longest delay path in a synchronous digital circuit between two registers (or an input port to a register, or a register to an output port) that limits the maximum clock frequency of the design.
  - `Maximum Frequency (F_max) = 1 / (t_cq + t_comb_max + t_su)` (ignoring clock skew for simplicity)
  - Analysis Involves:
    1. Using Static Timing Analysis (STA) tools to identify paths with negative setup slack or the smallest positive slack.
    2. Examining the components along this path (specific gates, wires, cells).
    3. Optimization Techniques:
       - **Logic restructuring:** Re-arranging logic to reduce depth (e.g., changing an adder from ripple-carry to carry-lookahead).
       - **Buffering:** Inserting buffers to strengthen signals on long wires.
       - **Cell sizing:** Using faster (but larger and more power-hungry) library cells for gates on the critical path.
       - **Pipelining:** Adding registers to break a long combinational path into shorter ones, increasing throughput and clock frequency but adding latency.
       - **Retiming:** Moving registers across combinational logic blocks without changing the functional behavior, to better balance path delays.

- **Clock Domain Crossing (CDC), metastability:**

  - **Clock Domain:** A part of a design that is clocked by a specific clock signal.
  - **Clock Domain Crossing (CDC):** Occurs when a signal passes from a flip-flop clocked by one clock (source domain) to a flip-flop clocked by another clock (destination domain) where the two clocks are asynchronous or have a variable phase relationship.
  - **Metastability:** An unpredictable state where a flip-flop's output has not settled to a stable '0' or '1' within the time allowed (e.g., before the next stage needs it). This can happen if setup or hold times are violated, which is a high risk at CDC boundaries if not handled correctly. A metastable output can oscillate or settle to a random value, causing functional failures.
  - CDC Handling Techniques:
    - **Synchronizers:** The most common solution for single-bit control signals. Typically consists of two or more flip-flops in the destination clock domain, cascaded together. The first flip-flop is prone to metastability, but the probability of the second (or third) flip-flop also going metastable is significantly reduced, allowing time for the signal to resolve. The Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) due to metastability increases exponentially with the number of synchronizer stages.
    - **Handshaking Protocols (e.g., request/acknowledge):** For multi-bit data or when confirmation of transfer is needed. A control signal indicates data validity, and an acknowledge signal from the receiver confirms receipt. Synchronizers are used on these control signals.
    - **Asynchronous FIFOs (First-In, First-Out buffers):** Used for transferring multi-bit data between clock domains. They have separate read and write pointers operating in their respective clock domains. Gray code pointers are often used for the FIFO full/empty status signals that cross domains to ensure only one bit changes at a time, simplifying synchronization.
    - **Formal Verification / CDC Linting Tools:** Specialized EDA tools to detect potential CDC issues, unsynchronized paths, and incorrect synchronizer implementations.

## üìò IV. System Architecture Topics (for advanced/high-tier roles)

These topics cover broader system-level concerns, often relevant for architects dealing with complex interactions between multiple components, security, and overall system optimization.

### 1. Security & Speculation üõ°Ô∏è

Modern processors use speculation to improve performance, but this can open up security vulnerabilities.

- Spectre, Meltdown: causes, mitigations:

  - **Speculative Execution:** Processors predict the outcome of branches or the target of indirect jumps and execute instructions along the predicted path *before* the actual outcome is known. If the prediction is correct, this saves time. If incorrect, the results of speculatively executed instructions are discarded.

  - **Side Channels:** Unintended information leakage paths. Speculative execution can leave traces of its operations in the microarchitectural state (e.g., cache state, TLB state, branch predictor state) even if the instructions are later discarded.

  - Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754 - Rogue Data Cache Load):

    - **Cause:** Exploits out-of-order execution in some processors (primarily Intel, some ARM). A user-mode instruction that would normally fault (e.g., trying to read kernel memory) is speculatively executed. Before the fault is raised and the instruction retired, a subsequent instruction in the speculative window can use the illicitly read data to perform a cache side-channel attack (e.g., access a cache line based on the secret data, then measure access time to infer the data). The fault eventually prevents the direct result from being committed, but the cache state has changed.
    - **Impact:** Allowed user-level applications to read arbitrary kernel memory, breaking OS security boundaries.
    - Mitigations:
      - **OS-level:** Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI, also known as KAISER or PTI). Separates user-space and kernel-space page tables more strongly, so most kernel memory is not mapped when user code is running, preventing speculative access. Incurs performance overhead due to TLB flushes on system calls.
      - **Microcode/Hardware:** Fixes in newer CPUs to prevent the specific speculative access patterns.

  - Spectre (CVE-2017-5753 - Bounds Check Bypass, CVE-2017-5715 - Branch Target Injection):

     

    A family of vulnerabilities that trick a victim process into speculatively executing instruction sequences that leak its own secret data through a side channel.

    - **Cause (Variant 1: Bounds Check Bypass):** Exploits conditional branch misprediction. An attacker "trains" the branch predictor for an `if (index < array_size)` check to predict "true" (in-bounds), then provides an out-of-bounds `index`. The processor speculatively executes the array access with the out-of-bounds index. The data read from this out-of-bounds location (secret data) is then used in a subsequent speculative instruction to create a cache side channel before the misprediction is detected and the speculative path is squashed.
    - **Cause (Variant 2: Branch Target Injection):** Exploits indirect branch predictors. An attacker "trains" the Branch Target Buffer (BTB) or similar indirect branch predictor to mispredict the target of an indirect branch in the victim's code to point to a "gadget" (a piece of existing victim code) chosen by the attacker. This gadget, when speculatively executed, uses victim data to create a side channel.
    - **Impact:** Allows an attacker to read memory from the same process (e.g., a web browser's JavaScript engine reading other browser data) or sometimes across processes/privilege levels.
    - Mitigations:
      - **Software:** Compiler-inserted speculation barriers (e.g., `lfence` on x86), retpolines (return trampolines to control indirect branches), site isolation in browsers.
      - **Microcode/Hardware:** Enhanced indirect branch predictors, changes to speculative execution behavior. Mitigating Spectre is more complex and often involves a combination of software and hardware approaches.

  - **Speculative execution and side channels:** The core issue is that speculative execution can change microarchitectural state (caches, predictors) based on data that *should not* have been accessed or operations that *should not* have been performed according to program logic. Attackers can then measure these changes (e.g., timing differences in cache access) to infer secret data. Other side channels besides cache timing include TLB timing, port contention, power analysis, etc. Research continues to find new variants and mitigations.

### 2. Memory Subsystem Optimization üöÄ

Focuses on improving the performance and efficiency of the entire memory hierarchy, from caches to DRAM.

- **Bandwidth, latency, NUMA, memory-level parallelism (MLP):**

  - **Bandwidth (Memory Bandwidth):** The rate at which data can be transferred between the processor and memory (or between levels of the memory hierarchy). Measured in GB/s (gigabytes per second). Crucial for data-intensive applications. Limited by bus width, frequency, number of channels, DRAM technology.

  - **Latency (Memory Latency):** The time delay for a memory access to complete, from the moment a request is issued until the data is available. Measured in nanoseconds (ns) or clock cycles. Critical for applications sensitive to single-thread performance and response time.

  - NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access):

     

    In multiprocessor systems, a memory architecture where different processors have different access latencies to different parts of main memory. Typically, each processor (or socket) has a local memory bank that it can access quickly. Accessing memory local to another processor incurs higher latency as the request has to go over an inter-processor interconnect.

    - **Implications:** OS and application schedulers need to be NUMA-aware to place processes and their data on the same NUMA node to minimize remote memory accesses (improving locality).

  - Memory-Level Parallelism (MLP):

     

    The ability of the processor and memory system to service multiple memory requests concurrently or in an overlapping manner.

    - Sources of MLP:
      - Out-of-order execution engines can issue multiple load/store operations before earlier ones complete.
      - Hardware prefetchers generate independent memory requests.
      - Multiple memory channels and DRAM banks allow concurrent accesses.
      - Cache MSHRs (Miss Status Holding Registers / Miss Handling Registers) track multiple outstanding cache misses.
    - High MLP helps to hide memory latency by keeping the memory system busy. If latency for one request is L cycles, but M requests can be overlapped, the effective latency per request can be closer to L/M.
    - Workloads with irregular access patterns or many dependencies might have low MLP.

- **Page coloring, huge pages, DRAM scheduling:**

  - **Page Coloring (Cache Coloring):** An OS memory management technique to influence how virtual pages are mapped to physical cache lines, particularly in physically indexed, virtually tagged (PIVT) or physically indexed, physically tagged (PIPT) caches. By controlling the physical page frame allocated to a virtual page, the OS can try to distribute an application's frequently used pages across different cache sets or cache slices to reduce conflict misses in the last-level cache (LLC). This can improve cache utilization and reduce inter-core interference.

  - Huge Pages:

     

    Using larger page sizes (e.g., 2MB or 1GB instead of the typical 4KB).

    - Benefits:
      - **Reduced TLB Pressure:** A single TLB entry can now map a much larger memory region, significantly reducing TLB misses for applications with large memory footprints. This reduces page walk overhead.
      - **Improved Prefetching:** Can make hardware prefetchers more effective over larger contiguous regions.
      - **Reduced Page Table Overhead:** Fewer page table entries are needed to map the same amount of memory.
    - Drawbacks:
      - **Internal Fragmentation:** If an application only uses a small portion of a huge page, the rest is wasted.
      - **Longer Page-in/Page-out Times:** Swapping larger pages to/from disk takes more time.
      - Granularity of memory protection and sharing becomes coarser.

  - DRAM Scheduling:

     

    The memory controller in a system is responsible for ordering and issuing commands (activate, precharge, read, write) to the DRAM chips to maximize bandwidth and minimize average latency, while respecting DRAM timing constraints (e.g., tRCD, tCAS, tRP, bank conflicts, refresh requirements).

    - Goals:
      - Maximize row buffer hits (by prioritizing requests to open rows).
      - Exploit bank-level parallelism (by interleaving requests to different banks).
      - Prioritize read requests over writes (as reads often stall the CPU directly).
      - Ensure fairness among different requestors (cores, accelerators).
      - Handle refresh commands without unduly impacting performance.
    - Common Policies:
      - **FR-FCFS (First-Ready, First-Come, First-Served):** Prioritizes older requests, but gives preference to those that can be serviced quickly (e.g., row hits).
      - **Stall-Time Fair Memory Scheduling:** Tries to ensure that no core is starved by giving priority to cores that have been stalled for longer.
      - Quality of Service (QoS) aware schedulers for heterogeneous systems.

### 3. Accelerator Integration üèéÔ∏è

Combining CPUs with specialized hardware accelerators to boost performance for specific tasks.

- **CPU + GPU + custom AI accelerator (heterogeneous systems):**

  - **Heterogeneous Computing:** Systems composed of different types of processing units to handle diverse computational workloads efficiently.
  - **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** General-purpose processor, good at control-flow intensive tasks, scalar operations, and running operating systems.
  - **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** Originally for graphics, now widely used for general-purpose parallel computing (GPGPU). Highly parallel architecture with thousands of simpler cores, excels at data-parallel tasks (e.g., matrix multiplication, simulations, image processing). High memory bandwidth.
  - **Custom AI Accelerators (e.g., TPUs, NPUs, VPUs):** Hardware designed specifically to accelerate machine learning (deep learning) workloads. Often optimized for operations like matrix multiplication and convolutions, with specialized data paths and memory hierarchies. Can offer significantly better performance and energy efficiency for AI tasks than CPUs or even GPUs.
  - **Challenges:** Programming models, data movement between different memory spaces, cache coherence, scheduling tasks across different units, system integration.

- **PCIe, CXL, cache coherent interconnects:** Standards for connecting accelerators and other peripherals to the CPU and system memory.

  - PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express):

     

    A high-speed serial computer expansion bus standard.

    - Used for connecting GPUs, SSDs, network cards, and other high-bandwidth peripherals to the motherboard.
    - Operates on a point-to-point topology with "lanes."
    - Generations (PCIe 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0) offer increasing bandwidth per lane.
    - Traditionally, devices connected via PCIe have their own memory, and data transfer to/from CPU memory involves explicit DMA (Direct Memory Access) operations managed by drivers, which can incur latency and software overhead. Cache coherence is typically not maintained by default between CPU caches and PCIe device memory.

  - CXL (Compute Express Link):

     

    An open standard interconnect built on top of the PCIe physical layer, designed to provide high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between CPUs, accelerators, memory expansion devices, and smart NICs.

    - Key Features & Protocols:
      - **CXL.io:** Functionally equivalent to PCIe, used for discovery, configuration, I/O.
      - **CXL.cache:** Allows an accelerator (device) to coherently access and cache data from the host (CPU) memory. The accelerator can participate in the CPU's cache coherence protocol (e.g., snooping CPU caches). This simplifies programming models by allowing shared memory access.
      - **CXL.mem:** Allows the host CPU to access memory attached to a CXL device (e.g., memory expansion modules, or memory on an accelerator) as part of its system memory space, potentially in a coherent manner. Enables memory pooling and tiering.
    - **Benefits:** Enables more tightly coupled heterogeneous systems, reduces data movement overhead, simplifies software development for accelerators by supporting shared virtual memory and cache coherence.

  - Cache Coherent Interconnects (beyond CXL for on-package/on-chip):

    - Proprietary interconnects used by CPU vendors to connect multiple cores, LLCs, and integrated GPUs on the same die or package (e.g., Intel's ring bus or mesh, AMD's Infinity Fabric).
    - Ensure cache coherence between all components sharing memory.
    - Emerging standards like UCIe (Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express) aim to provide open, standardized die-to-die interconnects for building systems from chiplets, which will also need to support coherence.

### 4. Power Management üîã

Techniques to reduce power consumption and improve energy efficiency.

- **DVFS, clock gating, power gating:**

  - DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling):
    - A power management technique where the operating voltage and/or clock frequency of a processor (or other components) are dynamically adjusted at runtime based on the current workload demand.
    - **How it works:** Reducing frequency reduces dynamic power linearly (`P_dyn ‚àù f`). Reducing voltage reduces dynamic power quadratically (`P_dyn ‚àù V^2`) and also reduces static (leakage) power. However, reducing voltage also reduces the maximum stable operating frequency.
    - **Implementation:** The OS or hardware power management unit monitors system load. If the load is low, it can reduce voltage and frequency to save power. If the load increases, it ramps them up to meet performance demands.
    - Common in CPUs, GPUs, and mobile SoCs.
  - Clock Gating:
    - A technique to reduce dynamic power by disabling the clock signal to parts of a circuit that are not currently active or changing state.
    - If a logic block is not needed for a number of cycles, its clock can be turned off, preventing flip-flops from toggling and combinational logic downstream from switching unnecessarily.
    - **Granularity:** Can be applied at various levels ‚Äì from entire modules (e.g., an FPU if no floating-point instructions are being executed) down to individual registers or small blocks of logic.
    - Implemented using "clock gating cells" (e.g., an AND gate or a latch-based gate) that can enable/disable the clock to a portion of the design based on an enable signal.
    - Very common and effective for saving dynamic power.
  - Power Gating:
    - A more aggressive technique to reduce static (leakage) power by completely shutting off the power supply to idle blocks of the circuit.
    - **How it works:** Special "power switches" (typically high-Vth transistors) are inserted between the power supply rails (VDD/GND) and the block to be gated. When the block is idle for an extended period, these switches are turned off.
    - **Benefits:** Significantly reduces leakage power in the gated block (as VDD is removed).
    - Challenges:
      - **State Loss:** The state of registers and memory within the power-gated domain is typically lost unless special retention flip-flops or SRAM cells are used (which add area/complexity and still consume some leakage).
      - **Wake-up Latency:** Turning the power back on and restoring state (if needed) takes time and energy (rush current).
      - Complexity in design and verification (power sequencing, isolation cells to prevent floating signals from affecting active domains).
    - Used for larger blocks that can be idle for significant durations (e.g., entire cores in a multicore processor, GPU cores, specialized accelerators).

- **Leakage vs dynamic power:**

  - Dynamic Power (Switching Power):

     

    Consumed when transistors switch states (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) due to logic activity.

    - ```
      P_dynamic ‚âà Œ± * C_L * V_DD^2 * f_clk
      ```

      - `Œ±`: Activity factor (probability that a signal switches per clock cycle).
      - `C_L`: Load capacitance being charged/discharged.
      - `V_DD`: Supply voltage.
      - `f_clk`: Clock frequency.

    - Also includes short-circuit power (when both PMOS and NMOS transistors in a CMOS gate are momentarily ON during switching).

    - Dominant power component when the chip is active and operating at high frequencies.

  - Static Power (Leakage Power):

     

    Consumed even when transistors are not switching, due to leakage currents.

    - Mainly subthreshold leakage (current flowing through a transistor even when it's nominally "off") and gate leakage (current tunneling through the gate oxide).
    - `P_static ‚âà I_leakage * V_DD`
    - Becomes increasingly significant as transistor feature sizes shrink (thinner gate oxides, lower threshold voltages make leakage worse).
    - Can be a dominant factor in total power consumption, especially when the chip is idle or in low-power states, or in technologies with high leakage characteristics.
    - Techniques like power gating, multi-Vth transistors (using high-threshold voltage transistors for non-critical paths to reduce leakage), and body biasing are used to manage leakage.

## üëî VI. Interview Essentials

This section covers the types of questions and skills often evaluated in computer architecture interviews.

### 1. Design Qs üí°

These questions assess your ability to apply architectural concepts to solve problems, make tradeoffs, and think at a system level.

- **Design a cache for XYZ workload:**

  - Understand the Workload (XYZ):

     

    This is the most crucial first step. Ask clarifying questions:

    - **Access Patterns:** Sequential, random, strided? Read-heavy, write-heavy, mixed?
    - **Data Size:** How large is the working set of the application?
    - **Locality:** Temporal (data reused soon) or spatial (nearby data used)?
    - **Performance Goals:** Latency-sensitive, throughput-sensitive?
    - **Constraints:** Power budget, area budget (if applicable)? Is it for a mobile device, server, embedded system?

  - Key Cache Parameters to Discuss & Justify:

    - **Cache Size (Capacity):** Should be large enough to hold the working set, but larger caches are slower, more power-hungry, and costlier.
    - Block Size (Line Size):
      - Larger blocks exploit spatial locality and reduce tag overhead but can increase miss penalty (more data to transfer) and might lead to pollution if spatial locality is poor.
      - Typical sizes: 32B, 64B, 128B.
    - Associativity (Direct-mapped, N-way Set-Associative, Fully Associative):
      - Higher associativity reduces conflict misses but increases complexity, access time (more comparisons), and power.
      - Direct-mapped is simplest but prone to conflicts.
      - Fully associative (for small caches like TLBs) has best hit rate for conflicts but is expensive.
      - Choose based on expected conflict levels and PPA tradeoffs.
    - Replacement Policy (LRU, PLRU, FIFO, Random):
      - LRU is often good but complex for high associativity. PLRU is a common compromise.
      - For some workloads (e.g., streaming with no reuse), FIFO or even a "bypass on write once" might be better.
    - Write Policy (Write-Through vs. Write-Back):
      - **Write-Through:** Simpler coherence, data always in memory. Can create write traffic. Often paired with a write buffer.
      - **Write-Back:** Reduces write traffic, generally better performance. Needs dirty bits, more complex coherence.
    - Write Allocation Policy (Write-Allocate vs. No-Write-Allocate):
      - On a write miss, should a block be allocated (brought into the cache)?
      - **Write-Allocate:** Usually paired with write-back. The block is fetched, then written. Good if there's subsequent locality to the written block.
      - **No-Write-Allocate (Write-Around):** Usually paired with write-through. The write goes directly to the next level of memory, bypassing the cache. Good if data is written once and not read soon.
    - Number of Cache Levels (L1, L2, LLC/L3):
      - L1: Small, very fast, private to a core.
      - L2: Larger, slower than L1, can be private or shared.
      - LLC: Largest, slowest cache, usually shared among cores, victim cache.
    - Special Features (depending on workload):
      - Prefetching mechanisms (if streaming data).
      - Victim cache (to hold recently evicted blocks).
      - Non-temporal access hints (if data won't be reused).
      - Way prediction (to speed up set-associative access).
      - Banked/sectored cache design (for bandwidth/power).

  - Example Scenario:

     

    For a workload with high spatial locality and a large working set (e.g., scientific computing on large arrays):

    - Relatively large LLC, moderate block size (e.g., 64B), high associativity (e.g., 8-16 way) for LLC to reduce conflicts, write-back with write-allocate.
    - Hardware prefetchers (stride, stream).

  - **Structure your answer:** State assumptions, discuss parameters, justify choices based on the workload, and acknowledge tradeoffs.

- **Optimize pipeline for power:**

  - Identify Power Consumers in a Pipeline:
    - **Clock Network:** Significant dynamic power due to high switching activity and large capacitance.
    - **Register Files & Reorder Buffers:** Large, frequently accessed.
    - **Execution Units:** ALUs, FPUs, shifters (especially if wide).
    - **Caches & TLBs:** Accesses and tag comparisons.
    - **Fetch & Decode Logic:** Instruction fetching, branch prediction logic.
    - **Inter-stage Latches/Registers:** Though small individually, collectively significant.
  - Power Optimization Techniques:
    - **Clock Gating:** (Discussed in IV.4) Aggressively gate clocks to unused units or pipeline stages. E.g., gate FPU clock if no FP instructions. Gate write ports of register file if no writeback.
    - **Operand Isolation / Data Gating:** Prevent unnecessary switching in functional units if their inputs are not changing or their outputs are not needed. E.g., if an ALU operation's result isn't used, don't let its internal nodes toggle.
    - **Reduced Voltage (part of DVFS):** Lowering supply voltage quadratically reduces dynamic power. May require architectural support for lower frequency operation.
    - **Pipeline Gating / Power Gating Stages:** If the entire pipeline or significant portions are idle, power gate them. More aggressive than clock gating, saves leakage too.
    - **Instruction Buffering & Throttling:** If backend is stalled, throttle fetching/decoding to save power in front-end.
    - Complexity Reduction in Critical Structures:
      - Simpler branch predictors if power is more critical than peak prediction accuracy.
      - Smaller, lower-associativity caches if power is a primary concern.
      - Less aggressive OoO mechanisms (e.g., smaller ROB, fewer reservation stations).
    - **Memory Access Optimization:** Reducing cache misses reduces power-hungry main memory accesses.
    - Microarchitecture-specific techniques:
      - E.g., in issue logic, avoid unnecessary comparisons or lookups.
      - Use narrower datapaths where possible if full width is not always needed.
      - Exploit value locality (e.g., value cache or memoization to avoid re-computation).
    - **Asynchronous Design Elements (selectively):** Can eliminate clock power for certain blocks, but design is much harder.
  - **Tradeoffs:** Many power optimizations can impact performance (e.g., smaller structures might increase miss rates or stalls) or area. The goal is often energy efficiency (perf/watt).
  - **Metrics:** Discuss how you would measure power (simulation tools like McPAT, Wattch, real hardware measurements) and the impact of optimizations.

- **Design a TLB or memory hierarchy for a virtualized system:**

  - Challenges of Virtualization for Memory Management:
    - **Two Levels of Address Translation:** Guest Virtual Address (GVA) ‚Üí Guest Physical Address (GPA) ‚Üí Host Physical Address (HPA or Machine Address). This "two-dimensional" page walk is slow if done entirely in software or naively in hardware.
    - TLB Issues:
      - **Tags:** TLB entries now need to store not just VPN‚ÜíPFN but also identify which VM/process they belong to (e.g., using a VMID or ASID).
      - **Increased Misses:** TLB might need to cater to multiple VMs and the hypervisor, potentially increasing conflict/capacity misses if not sized appropriately or if context switching is frequent.
      - **Shadow Page Tables (older software technique):** Hypervisor maintained page tables mapping GVA directly to HPA. Complex to keep consistent.
  - Hardware Support for Virtualization (e.g., Intel EPT, AMD RVI/NPT):
    - **Nested Page Tables (NPT) / Extended Page Tables (EPT):** Hardware performs the two-dimensional page walk. The CPU has structures to walk both guest page tables and host page tables (often called nested page tables).
    - **Tagged TLBs:** TLB entries include a VMID or ASID to distinguish translations for different VMs/processes, avoiding TLB flushes on VM switches.
  - Designing the TLB for Virtualization:
    - **Larger Capacity:** To accommodate entries from multiple VMs and the hypervisor.
    - **Higher Associativity:** To reduce conflict misses due to interleaved access from different VMs.
    - **VMID/ASID Tagging:** Essential for performance.
    - **Hierarchical TLBs (L1, L2 TLB):** Similar to caches, a small, fast L1 TLB and a larger, slower L2 TLB.
    - **Selective TLB Flushing:** On context switch or page table changes, flush only relevant entries (e.g., based on VMID) rather than the entire TLB.
    - **Prefetching for TLBs:** If guest access patterns are predictable, hardware could prefetch translations.
    - **Support for Different Page Sizes:** (4KB, 2MB, 1GB) Huge pages are even more critical in virtualized environments to reduce TLB pressure. The TLB must support these.
  - Designing the Memory Hierarchy (Caches) for Virtualization:
    - Cache Partitioning/Awareness:
      - Last-Level Cache (LLC) can become a point of contention between VMs. Hardware/software techniques for partitioning LLC ways among VMs (e.g., Intel Cache Allocation Technology - CAT) can provide QoS and prevent "noisy neighbor" problems.
      - Hypervisor needs to be aware of cache topology for smart VM scheduling.
    - I/O Virtualization (e.g., SR-IOV, Intel VT-d):
      - How I/O devices access memory in a virtualized setup. DMA remapping (IOMMU) is crucial to translate GPA from device DMAs to HPA and enforce isolation.
      - Caches might need to interact with IOMMU for coherent DMA.
    - **Coherence:** Standard coherence protocols generally work, but the scale and interaction with hypervisor/NPTs need consideration.
  - Key Tradeoffs:
    - Hardware complexity (for NPT walkers, tagged TLBs) vs. software overhead.
    - TLB/cache size vs. area/power.
    - Fairness vs. overall throughput.
  - **Discuss interactions with the hypervisor:** How the hypervisor manages guest page tables, handles nested page faults, and interacts with hardware virtualization features.

### 2. Behavioral Qs üó£Ô∏è

These questions assess your soft skills, problem-solving approach, and past experiences. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers.

- **"Tell me about a time you debugged a complex architecture bug":**

  - **Situation:** Briefly describe the project and the system you were working on. What were the symptoms of the bug? (e.g., incorrect results, crashes, performance degradation, simulation mismatch). Why was it complex? (e.g., intermittent, hard to reproduce, deep in the pipeline, interaction between multiple components).

  - **Task:** What was your specific role and responsibility in finding and fixing the bug?

  - Action:

     

    Detail the steps you took. This is the core of your answer.

    - **Hypothesis generation:** What were your initial theories?
    - **Information gathering:** How did you collect data? (e.g., simulation traces, waveform analysis, performance counters, adding debug logic/print statements, code inspection).
    - **Isolation:** How did you narrow down the source of the bug? (e.g., simplifying test cases, disabling parts of the design, focused simulations).
    - **Tools used:** Mention specific simulators, debuggers, waveform viewers, scripts.
    - **Collaboration:** Did you work with others? How?
    - **Perseverance:** Did you hit dead ends? How did you overcome them?

  - **Result:** What was the root cause of the bug? How was it fixed? What was the impact of the fix? What did you learn from the experience? (e.g., better design practices, new debugging techniques, importance of assertions).

  - **Example Bug Types:** Coherence issues, race conditions in RTL, pipeline hazard not handled correctly, memory consistency model violation, incorrect FSM transition, timing-related functional bug.

- **"Walk me through your favorite project and the tradeoffs you made":**

  - **Project Overview:** Briefly describe the project, its goals, and your role. Why was it your favorite? (e.g., challenging, impactful, learned a lot).

  - **Key Design Choices/Features:** Focus on 1-2 significant aspects of the project where you had to make important decisions.

  - Tradeoffs:

     

    For each design choice, explicitly discuss the tradeoffs you considered. This is critical.

    - **PPA (Power, Performance, Area):** How did your choices impact these? For example, "We considered a larger cache for better performance, but the area and static power increase was too significant for our mobile target, so we opted for a smaller cache with a smart prefetcher."
    - **Complexity vs. Benefit:** Was a more complex solution chosen for a significant gain, or was simplicity favored?
    - **Time-to-Market / Development Effort:** Did this influence choices?
    - **Scalability, Flexibility, Reusability.**

  - **Your Rationale:** Explain *why* you made the decisions you did. What data, analysis, or reasoning supported your choices? (e.g., simulation results, literature review, requirements).

  - **Outcome/Impact:** What was the result of these decisions and the project overall? Was it successful?

  - **Lessons Learned:** What would you do differently next time? What insights did you gain about design or making tradeoffs?

  - **Be Specific:** Use concrete examples and numbers if possible. Avoid vague statements. Show your thought process.

## ‚úÖ Summary ‚Äî You Should Be Able To:

This is a good checklist of core competencies.

- **Skill: Read & write Verilog**
  - Goal: Design a simple CPU/memory unit
    - **CPU:** Be able to design a basic pipelined (or even single-cycle) RISC processor: fetch unit (PC logic), decode unit (control signal generation), register file, ALU, memory access interface. Understand how instructions flow through it.
    - **Memory Unit:** Design a simple cache controller (e.g., direct-mapped or set-associative) with logic for hit/miss detection, data fetching from a higher level, block replacement, and write policies.
- **Skill: Analyze pipeline**
  - Goal: Identify and fix hazards
    - **Identification:** Given a sequence of instructions and a pipeline structure, identify potential RAW, WAR, WAW, structural, and control hazards.
    - Fixing:
      - **Data Hazards:** Implement forwarding paths (show the logic/multiplexers needed). Determine when stalling is necessary and implement stall logic.
      - **Control Hazards:** Understand branch prediction, calculate misprediction penalties, implement pipeline flushing on mispredict.
      - **Structural Hazards:** Suggest solutions like duplicating resources or scheduling resource usage.
- **Skill: Understand cache/memory hierarchy**
  - Goal: Tune it for workload efficiency
    - Understand how cache parameters (size, block size, associativity, replacement/write policies) affect hit/miss rates and average memory access time (AMAT).
    - Given a workload description (access patterns, working set size), suggest appropriate cache configurations.
    - Explain concepts like write buffers, prefetching, victim caches, and when they are beneficial.
    - Calculate AMAT: `AMAT = Hit_Time + Miss_Rate * Miss_Penalty`.
- **Skill: Simulate in gem5 (or similar)**
  - Goal: Run and evaluate performance metrics
    - Basic ability to set up a gem5 simulation (or another simulator).
    - Know how to configure CPU models, memory systems.
    - Run benchmark programs.
    - Extract key output statistics (e.g., CPI, IPC, cache miss rates, branch prediction accuracy) and interpret them.
    - Understand how to vary architectural parameters and observe their impact on performance.
- **Skill: Explain ISA + microarchitecture tradeoffs**
  - Goal: Pick the right design for a target workload
    - **ISA:** Discuss RISC vs. CISC pros and cons. Impact of instruction formats, addressing modes, vector extensions on complexity, code density, performance.
    - Microarchitecture:
      - Pipeline depth (frequency vs. penalty).
      - In-order vs. Out-of-Order (complexity, IPC, power).
      - Superscalar width (IPC vs. complexity, diminishing returns).
      - Branch predictor complexity vs. accuracy vs. power.
      - Cache hierarchy choices.
    - **Connecting to Workload:** How would you tailor these choices for different application types (e.g., general-purpose computing, embedded control, DSP, machine learning, high-performance scientific computing)? Consider PPA constraints for each.
