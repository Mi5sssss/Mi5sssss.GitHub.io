## My research focus on ðŸ“š

- Computer architecture and system design
- Matrix Computation and Optimization

<!-- The acceleration of large Memristor Crossbar Arrays (MCAs) is important for the SPICE of crossbar structure. We have built a preconditioner for the existing architecture through Modified Nodal Analysis Equations.

Also we have built a simulator including Noise (Pink, RTN) and nonlinearity of memristor for basic train networks.

Here is MNIST as input.

We want to make Look up tables for the real memristor which would help to facilitate our simulator.

My ultimate goal and current plan. -->
